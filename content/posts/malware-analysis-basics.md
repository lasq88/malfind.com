# Introduction to Malware Analysis: A Practical Guide

Malware analysis is the process of understanding the behavior and purpose of malicious software. This guide provides a foundation for security researchers looking to develop their analysis skills.

## Types of Malware Analysis

### Static Analysis
Static analysis involves examining malware without executing it:

```bash
# File type identification
file suspicious_sample.exe
strings suspicious_sample.exe | grep -i "http\|registry\|file"

# PE header analysis
peframe suspicious_sample.exe
```

### Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis involves running malware in a controlled environment:

```python
# Basic sandbox analysis
import subprocess
import time

def analyze_sample(sample_path):
    # Run in isolated environment
    result = subprocess.run(['sandbox', sample_path], 
                          capture_output=True, 
                          timeout=300)
    return result.stdout.decode()
```

## Essential Tools

### Static Analysis Tools
- **PEiD**: PE file identification
- **IDA Pro**: Disassembler and debugger
- **Ghidra**: Free reverse engineering tool
- **YARA**: Pattern matching for malware

### Dynamic Analysis Tools
- **Cuckoo Sandbox**: Automated malware analysis
- **Process Monitor**: Real-time file and registry monitoring
- **Wireshark**: Network traffic analysis
- **API Monitor**: API call tracking

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - File type and basic properties
   - Antivirus detection results
   - Network indicators

2. **Static Analysis**
   - String extraction
   - Import/export analysis
   - Code disassembly

3. **Dynamic Analysis**
   - Sandbox execution
   - Network behavior monitoring
   - System changes observation

4. **Documentation**
   - IOC (Indicators of Compromise) extraction
   - Behavioral analysis report
   - Mitigation recommendations

## Common Malware Behaviors

### Persistence Mechanisms
```registry
# Registry run keys
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

# Scheduled tasks
schtasks /create /tn "MaliciousTask" /tr "C:\malware.exe" /sc onstart
```

### Network Communication
- C2 (Command and Control) servers
- Data exfiltration
- Additional payload downloads
- Botnet communication

## Best Practices

1. **Always use isolated environments**
2. **Document everything**
3. **Follow the principle of least privilege**
4. **Keep analysis tools updated**
5. **Share findings responsibly**

## Conclusion

Malware analysis is a critical skill in cybersecurity. By combining static and dynamic analysis techniques, security researchers can better understand threats and develop effective countermeasures.

*Remember: Always analyze malware in isolated environments and follow your organization's security policies.*
